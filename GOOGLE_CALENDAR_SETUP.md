# Google Calendar Booking Integration Setup

This guide will help you set up Google Calendar OAuth integration for the booking functionality.

## Prerequisites

- A Google Cloud Platform account
- A project in Google Cloud Console

## Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click "Select a project" at the top
3. Click "NEW PROJECT"
4. Enter a project name (e.g., "Saga Health Booking")
5. Click "CREATE"

## Step 2: Enable Google Calendar API

1. In the Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services** > **Library**
2. Search for "Google Calendar API"
3. Click on it and press **ENABLE**

## Step 3: Configure OAuth Consent Screen

1. Go to **APIs & Services** > **OAuth consent screen**
2. Select **External** user type
3. Click **CREATE**
4. Fill in the required fields:
   - **App name**: Saga Health
   - **User support email**: Your email
   - **Developer contact information**: Your email
5. Click **SAVE AND CONTINUE**
6. On the "Scopes" page, click **ADD OR REMOVE SCOPES**
7. Add the following scope:
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar` (full access to Google Calendar)
8. Click **UPDATE** and then **SAVE AND CONTINUE**
9. On "Test users" page (if in testing mode):
   - Click **ADD USERS**
   - Add your Gmail address and any other test users
   - Click **SAVE AND CONTINUE**
10. Review and click **BACK TO DASHBOARD**

## Step 4: Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials

1. Go to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**
2. Click **CREATE CREDENTIALS** > **OAuth client ID**
3. Select **Web application** as the application type
4. Enter a name (e.g., "Saga Health Web Client")
5. Under **Authorized JavaScript origins**, add:
   - `http://localhost:5173` (for local development)
   - Your production domain (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`)
6. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add:
   - `http://localhost:5173` (for local development)
   - Your production domain (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`)
7. Click **CREATE**
8. Copy your **Client ID** - you'll need this!

## Step 5: Add Environment Variables

1. Open your `.env` file in the project root
2. Add the following variables:

```env
# Google Calendar OAuth
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-here.apps.googleusercontent.com

# Optional: If you need additional API access
VITE_GOOGLE_CALENDAR_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

3. Replace `your-client-id-here` with the Client ID from Step 4
4. Save the file

## Step 6: Restart Development Server

After updating the `.env` file, restart your development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Testing the Integration

1. Navigate to a service in your wellness marketplace
2. Click "Book Now"
3. Click "Sign in with Google"
4. Grant calendar access permissions
5. Select a date and available time slot
6. Click "Confirm Booking"
7. The appointment should appear in your Google Calendar!

## Troubleshooting

### "Error 400: redirect_uri_mismatch"
- Make sure your redirect URI in Google Cloud Console matches your application URL exactly
- Check that you've added both `http://localhost:5173` and your production URL

### "Access blocked: Authorization Error"
- Ensure your OAuth consent screen is properly configured
- If in testing mode, make sure your Google account is added as a test user
- Check that the Google Calendar API scope is added

### "Failed to authenticate with Google"
- Verify your Client ID is correct in the `.env` file
- Make sure the `.env` file is in the project root
- Restart your development server after changing environment variables

### No available time slots showing
- Check that you've granted calendar permissions
- Verify the selected date is in the future
- Try selecting a different date

### Booking fails to create
- Ensure you have "Make changes to events" permission granted
- Check browser console for specific error messages
- Verify your access token is valid

## Production Deployment

When deploying to production:

1. Update OAuth credentials in Google Cloud Console:
   - Add your production domain to **Authorized JavaScript origins**
   - Add your production domain to **Authorized redirect URIs**

2. Set environment variables on your hosting platform:
   - `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
   - `VITE_GOOGLE_CALENDAR_API_KEY` (if needed)

3. If using OAuth in production:
   - Consider moving to "In production" status in OAuth consent screen
   - This requires verification by Google if you have sensitive scopes
   - For internal use, you can stay in testing mode with specific users

## Security Best Practices

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- üîí Keep your Client ID and API keys secure
- üîê Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- üë• Limit OAuth consent screen to necessary scopes only
- üîÑ Regularly review and rotate credentials if compromised

## Features Implemented

‚úÖ **Google OAuth Login** - Secure authentication with Google  
‚úÖ **Calendar API Integration** - Read user's calendar for availability  
‚úÖ **Free/Busy Time Slots** - Shows available 1-hour slots (9 AM - 5 PM)  
‚úÖ **Event Creation** - Books appointments directly in Google Calendar  
‚úÖ **Automatic Reminders** - Email reminder 24 hours before, popup 30 min before  
‚úÖ **Success Confirmation** - Clear feedback when booking is complete  

## API Rate Limits

- Google Calendar API has a default quota of 1,000,000 queries per day
- Per-user limit: 10 requests per second
- For most applications, these limits are sufficient
